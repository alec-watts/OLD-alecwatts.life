      Throughout my sophmore year of college, I became personally invested in health tech. I purchased an Apple Watch to track my exercise/calory burn. I purchased a subscription to the <a href="https://www.headspace.com/">Headspace Meditaton App</a> in an effort to improve my mental health and self-control. I also began to track my calory consumption with <a href="https://cronometer.com/">Cronometer</a>. I found these investments to be incredibly rewarding.
      
      <br> <br>
      When it came to alcohol, I found that even the most health conscious individuals considered drinking to be an exception to their health crusade. More specifically, I saw that people are completely willing to sacrifice all of their agency to alcohol. With each drink, humans have less control over whether or not they will have another.
      
      <br> <br>
      I have no goal of spreading absolute sobriety throughout the world. In fact, I consume alcohol. I did, however, think it would be helpful to give individuals some firepower in their fight to maintain control when drinking.
      
      <br> <br>
      I created a simple iPhone application where users could track their drinks, familiarizing myself with XCode, Swift, and SwiftUI in the process. I quickly realized that ease of use is the top priority. Believe it or not, intoxicated individuals are not particularly motivated to open an app on their phone to log a beer.

      <br> <br>
      I immediately developed an Apple Watch application that would transform the process into a simple tap on the wrist. I also figured that Apple Watch users would be early adopters given their commitment to health. This iPhone and Watch applications sync data.

      <br> <br>
      <b>My FAVORITE ease-of-use feature:</b> 
      <br>
      In Beta, I created an <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios">Apple Shortcut</a> that allows users to easily log a drink. Next, I linked the shortcut to the iPhone's <a href="https://youtu.be/aZzT538F92Y?t=34">Back Tap Feature (MKBHD video)</a>. The final result: you can log a drink to the Consume app by simply tapping the back of your iPhone.

    <!-- RECREATION -->

      <h2>Recreation Cannabis Grinders</h2>
    </a>
    <p>
      I began building Recreation with my brother Ian Watts, in August of 2022. Ian is a University of Michigan Alum with a degree in Mechanical Engineering. 
      <br> <br>
      As young kids, my brother would spend summer days in our garage wielding power tools constructing wood working projects. Not sure how we kept all of our fingers. Our first project was a Go-Kart built on top of a Radio Flyer Wagon. After watching Lord of the Rings, we thought it was time to build a catapult powered by bungee cords. Impressively we could launch a tennis ball some 60 feet.
      <br> <br>
      As we grew older, we began to take on more ambitious projects. When my brother got a Makergear M2 3D printer for his 16th birthday, we began to learn the power of iterative design. Within a matter of hours we could print many variations of any given part. We used this 3D printer to create the first prototypes of what would become the Recreation Grinder.
      <br> <br>
      We began the design process by analyzing leaders in the luxury cannabis grinder industry such as <a href="https://santacruzshredder.com/">Santa Cruz</a> and <a href="https://www.hoj.life/products/klip">Hoj</a>. Next we took a first principals approach to how we could differentiate our product.
      <br> <br>
      The final product is significantly lighter than the competition, uses magnetic connections (instead of threading) to connect all pieces, and is completely modular. This design process along with my brother and I's passion for design has resulted in a product that is both beautiful and functional.
